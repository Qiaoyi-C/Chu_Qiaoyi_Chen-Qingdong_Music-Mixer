# Symphony Orchestra Concert - Music-Mixer
![Symphony Orchestra Concert ](images/template.png)
This is a symphony concert. The audience can choose their favorite instruments and drag them into the circle to create music with different combinations of instruments. We use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

About our HTML, CSS and JavaScript:
For the HTML we have added the elements and content we need, but still need to adjust, I added two colored squares for testing the drag animation. In the css part, we added the background image of the active section and some appearance of the buttons and the background colors of the instruments and instruments we need. In the JavaScript part, we use several JavaScript events, such as: "ondragenter", "ondragleave", "ondragover", "preventDefault", "ondrop", these can currently be run through the console in our project, I will refer to the information Placed in the assets folder. When you drag the green object into the red object, the console will display "Start dragging object!" and "Drag ends --------------" and "The drag target passes over the placement object and is not placed in the placement object." But when you drag the green object past the red object but do not place the green object in the red object, "The object crossed the box and did not land in the box." will be displayed. But we now encounter a problem. After completing dragging to the red object, the console will display "Drag ends ***************" repeatedly many times during the drag process. .


## Describe
Our final product should be to place instruments in a circle and play different music depending on the instrument placed inside.
